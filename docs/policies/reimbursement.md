# Reimbursement

Catalyst has two reimbursement policies available to members:

- [Home Office Reimbursements](home-office) $3,000 / 3 years
- [Catalyst IRL Reimbursements](irl) $200 / year

Reimbursement requests for one-off purchases approved by the board are also acceptable in certain circumstances.

**Reimbursement Process:** Members will make their own purchases and submit receipts via the [Expense Reimbursement Form](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rZxUUzib7Qb05Kz8aTxENd2QRv1d4oSEwQS-3OPsuX4) . They should be reimbursed within the payroll period following submission of complete documentation of the purchase. Members should confirm that their planned purchase is eligible for reimbursement under IRS rules and that they have sufficient remaining reimbursement funds before making the purchase.

**The co-op will maintain a record of reimbursements visible to all members including:**

- Date of purchase
- Name of member reimbursed
- Type of reimbursement (asset purchase or expense)
- The amount reimbursed
- A description of purchase including identifying information like laptop make, model, and serial number.
- A digital copy of receipts, invoices, or other proofs of purchase.
- Calculated values:
  - The remaining undepreciated value of all asset purchases associated with each member (this is the amount the member would owe the co-op if they left).
  - The remaining reimbursement budget available to each member.

## Home Office Reimbursements

**Provided to:** Members only

As an all-remote organization it’s important that we ensure our members have a comfortable and productive work environment. Due to favorable tax treatment, using co-op funds to this end is significantly more cost-effective than requiring members to cover these expenses out of pocket.

Each member will be reimbursed **up to $3,000 in any rolling 3-year period** to furnish and maintain their remote work environment, subject to the following conditions:

- The expenditure must qualify as a business expense, which the co-op can deduct from its income for tax purposes.
- The member must provide the co-op with receipts or other documentation of the business expense for our records, in the event that we are audited by the IRS and need to demonstrate the legitimacy of the tax deduction.
  The amount available to be reimbursed to a member at any given time will be **$3000** minus the sum of all reimbursements they’ve received in the preceding rolling **3 year period**. Each expenditure will be categorized as either an **asset purchase**, or an **expense.**

**Asset Purchases** include tangible non-consumable items that you purchase once and use for a period of time. E.g. a laptop, monitor, office chair, external backup drive, ergonomic keyboard, headphones, hardware 2FA keys, reference books, etc.

**Asset Depreciation:** We will use [straight-line depreciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation#Straight-line_depreciation) to depreciate the value of the asset over **3 years**. The remaining value of the asset before it is fully depreciated is known as the undepreciated value.

**Reimbursement of Undepreciated Value:** When a member leaves the co-op the remaining undepreciated value of the member’s reimbursed assets becomes a debt owed to the co-op. Like other debts owed to the co-op, it may be deducted from the departing member’s capital account / member share. The member will owe this debt to the co-op even if the asset has been damaged, stolen, or destroyed. **We strongly encourage members to ensure expensive items like laptops are covered by a manufacturer’s warranty, and to maintain an appropriate renters or homeowners insurance policy** so that these assets can be replaced if need be without additional cost to the member.

**For example**, an employee buys a $600 standing desk and is reimbursed by the cooperative. Since the standing desk depreciates (that is, loses value due to wear and tear) over 3 years, after one year the standing desk is valued at $400. So when the employee decides to leave the cooperative 2 years after the purchase of the standing desk, it is valued at $200. The departing employee would then need to pay the cooperative $200. Alternatively, the cooperative could deduct $200 from the departing employee’s internal member capital account.
**For a more comprehensive example:\_ [see this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bwzw7_GcWNSTBNeUFrWe8BzEyIA2Cw7HnjEwg6TueiY/edit#gid=867743421)**.

**Expenses:** will be reimbursed on a month to month basis as they are incurred. They do not result in a potential future liability for the member (unlike asset purchases) since they’re being consumed continuously. This is meant to cover things like membership at a co-working space, improved home internet service for work purposes, an off-site backup service for your computer, enrollment in online courses for continuing education, etc. Monthly expense reimbursements to a member shall be limited to the total per-member reimbursement budget divided by the number of months in the rolling reimbursement period. Given the current limits of $3000 every 36 months this works out to 2\*($3000/36 mo) = **$166.66/mo**. If a member has an expense greater than this amount, they can get reimbursed for it in installments over multiple months, so long as they remain a member.

## Catalyst IRL Reimbursement

**Provided to:** Members only

As a remote organization, Catalysters rarely see one another in person. To encourage folks to bridge the virtual divide, each member may request reimbursement for up to **$200 per year** for travel and food expenses related to visiting another member of the coop. These expenses must be _marginal and additional_ to existing plans where the primary purpose of the expenses is visiting another co-oper . Receipts must be submitted through the expense reimbursement form for approval by Steve and reimbursement.

**Example:** A member seeks reimbursement for a flight to the other side of the country. They stay with their family friends for a week and then take a bus to a neighboring town to meet up with another co-oper and go out to lunch. Because the primary purpose of the flight is to see family and friends, the co-oper should foot the bill for the flight. The co-oper may request a reimbursement for travel to visit the other co-oper as well as the bill for their lunch together.

If you are uncertain about whether an expense may be reimbursable, use your best judgment, and reach out to our Chief Financial Officer, Steve Winter, for clarification.
