# Catalyst Cooperative Handbook

Welcome to the Catalyst Cooperative Handbook! This handbook contains the cooperative's bylaws, policies and general information.

The handbook allows members to version control and review changes to the cooperative policies. We also hope it gives prospective members and other cooperatives insight into how we operate.

## Table of Contents

- [**Catalyst 101**](catalyst_101) contains useful background about Catalyst, cooperatives and our onboarding process.
- [**Catalyst How Tos**](catalyst_howtos) explains how to do common tasks at Catalyst like time tracking.
- The [**Policies**](policies) page contains information about our cooperative policies such as paid time off and benefits. Changes to this page are typically born out of governance discussions.
