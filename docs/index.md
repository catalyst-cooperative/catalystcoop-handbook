# Catalyst Cooperative Handbook

Welcome to the Catalyst Cooperative Handbook! This handbook contains the cooperative's bylaws, policies and general information.

The handbook allows members to version control and review changes to the cooperative policies. We also hope it gives prospective members and other cooperatives insight into how we operate.
