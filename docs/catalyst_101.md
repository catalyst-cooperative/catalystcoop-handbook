### Catalyst in 30 Seconds

Need an elevator pitch for your family or your linked-in? Here’s the spiel:

Catalyst Cooperative is a worker-owned, mission-driven tech cooperative that is committed to making public energy data more accessible. We clean and connect financial, operational, material, and environmental power plant data from sources such as FERC, EIA, and EPA and publish them in various machine and human readable formats. All of our code and data products are open source; we pursue grants to bolster this bottom line and client partnerships to add more analysis to the data. Our goal is to provide clean energy advocates with the tools to make meaningful policy recommendations that can expedite the transition away from fossil fuels.

## Co-op FAQ

Hold up. What /is/ a co-op? What makes it different from a non-profit or a regular corporate start-up? Here’s a high level overview:

**Q: What is a worker cooperative?**

**A:** A Worker cooperatives (aka co-ops) are jointly-owned, democratically-governed, values-driven businesses that prioritizes equality, solidarity, and worker well-being. Co-ops must officially register as such in the state of their choice.

**Q: What is the difference between a worker co-op and a nonprofit?**

**A:** Co-ops and nonprofits are both mission-driven, community-centric organizations, but there are some key differences. As tax-exempt entities, nonprofits are required to engage in specific educational or charitable pursuits as defined by the state in which they are registered. Co-ops have no such restrictions. Nonprofits are also barred from redistributing profits to investors or members whereas co-ops distribute their wealth to members. Nonprofit funding is also limited to grants and donations versus co-ops which can acquire an unrestricted portion of funds from the sale of goods and services.

**Q: What is the difference between a worker co-op and a for-profit corporation?**

**A:** Co-ops are another type of corporation, just like nonprofits and for-profits. The main difference between a co-op and a traditional for-profit entity is ownership. Where corporations are owned by individuals or shareholders, co-ops are owned by their employees or patrons. Co-op ownership shares are usually determined by patronage making them more equitably distributed than shares or stocks in for-profit entities. Co-ops also have a strict one-person-one-vote policy unlike for-profit shareholders whose influence is often proportional to their share of the company. Because co-ops are owned by people that are directly involved in the business, they are accountable to the success and well-being of their employees or patrons rather than external shareholders.

**Q: What are some of the benefits of worker co-ops over other types of corporations?**

**A:** Co-ops are a great middle ground between nonprofits and for profits. They provide a direct correlation between serving the community and benefiting those who serve; they endow the traditional business model with accountability and a true service mentality; and they align employee and business needs.

**Q: Where do coop profits go?**
