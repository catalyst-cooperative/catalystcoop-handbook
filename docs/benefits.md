# Benefits

## Paid Time-Off

**Provided to:** Employee-Members only

Members accrue **1 hour of paid time off for each 52 hours of work**. This is equivalent to getting 1 week (5 days) of paid time off each year when working at a rate of 30 hours per week. Catalyst will not loan paid time off hours to members in advance of their accrual; members cannot use paid time off hours that they have not yet accrued. At the end of each year, unused paid time off hours roll over to the next year. If a member leaves from the cooperative and has accrued paid time off hours, those hours will be converted to payments made in the same manner as the member’s internal capital account redemption.

New members are granted 10 hours of paid time off to start with, to reflect the time they spent as a candidate / contractor.

## Time-Off & Reduced Hours

**Provided to:** Members & Contractors

### Notification Policy
Notification of absence or reduced hours must be sent at least as far in advance from the date of absence as the absence is long. EX: eight days of vacation requires eight days of advance notice. 
For notifications requiring board permission: copy the contents of the [Member Time Off Request](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nzaVzdXkwDmj9VqEh0vboRlbJo8-4Izs80K_0QuImJA/edit) into an email, fill it out, and send it to the board. Those utilizying this policy are not required to provide an explanation for why they are taking time off or reducing their hours. Approval shall not be contingent on providing a justification for the request.
- For absence less than a week: send a slack message to the team channel explaining when you will be gone, and tag @channel so that everyone is notified.
- For absence greater than a week: send an email to everyone explaining when you will be gone and to what extent you can be contacted.
- Each person’s google calendar should show when they are “out of office”.

### Time-Off: *Working 0 hours per week*

**Requires Notification:**

- Members may take **up to two consecutive weeks** (10 consecutive work days) of time off without seeking explicit permission from the Board. Those utilizing this policy for at least one full day are expected to notify their team (and encouraged to notify others) in accordance with the notification policy so their absence can be accomodated. 

**Requires Board Permission:**

- Members seeking **more than two consecutive weeks** of time off must  submit a written request to the Board in accordance with the notification policy. Those utilizing this time off policy are expected to communicate with their teams regarding the viability of their absence beforehand. Approval of leave will be contingent on the ability of the cooperative to continue operating as a viable economic entity. 

### Reduced Hours: *Working <20 hours per week for more than two weeks*

**Requires Board Permission:**

- Members seeking to work at a reduced rate for **more than two consecutive weeks** must submit a written request to the Board in accordance with the notification policy. Those utilizing this reduced hours policy are expected to communicate with their teams regarding the viability of their schedule shift beforehand. Once the request has been submitted, members should  work together with their team to create a viable work plan. This may include reducing overhead like check-in meetings. Approval of the work plan will be contingent on the ability of the cooperative to continue operating as a viable economic entity. 

### Missing Meetings
Whether taking large chunks of time off or going to a doctor's appointment for a few hours, members and contractors are expected to communicate when they are going to be absent from meetings. This is best accomplished by rejecting calendar invites and notifying relevant parties on slack.

A decision should be made regarding whether to reschedule or carry on with the meeting.   

### Maintaining Membership & Good Standing
Members and contractors should consider the following rules when considering taking time off or reducing their hours:
- Pursuant to the expected hours policy, members  must work a total of 1000 hours in a calendar year in order to sustain their membership in the cooperative. 
- Regardless of hours worked, a member cannot take more than 6 months of consecutive leave without resigning their membership in the cooperative. 
- To be eligible for the monthly healthcare stipend, members must have worked a rolling 1000 hours over the past 12 months (pro-rated for those that have been with the co-op for less than a year). 
- Members and contractors are encouraged and expected  to keep their team members informed and update their calendar as to their availability on a regular basis.

## Health Care

**Provided to:** Members & Contractors

Catalyst provides a healthcare reimbursement of **$150 a month** to members and contractors working 1000 hours per year on a rolling 12 month basis (or in the case of new contractors/employees, the prorated amount of hours since they began working).

## Retirement Accounts

**Provided to:** Employee-Members only

Catalyst employees can contribute to a tax-deferred [Vanguard SIMPLE IRA](https://investor.vanguard.com/small-business-retirement-plans/simple-ira) and the co-op will match 3% of the employee’s wages. The IRS limit on annual employee contributions as of 2022 is $14,000. Here is a good summary of [how a SIMPLE IRA works](https://www.paychex.com/articles/employee-benefits/what-is-a-simple-ira) . Employees can contribute to the SIMPLE IRA and still contribute to a traditional individual IRA or Roth IRA.
