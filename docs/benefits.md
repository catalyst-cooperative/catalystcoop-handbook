# Benefits

## Unpaid Time-Off

**Provided to:** Members & Contractors

Members may take up to 2 weeks (10 consecutive working days) of unpaid time off, so long as they notify the Board of their scheduled absence at least 2 weeks in advance. Members may request more than 2 weeks of unpaid time off by submitting a written request to the Board at least as far in advance of the absence as the absence will be long. For example, a 1 month long leave would need to be requested at least 1 month in advance. Approval of periods of unpaid leave in excess of 2 weeks will be contingent on the ability of the cooperative to continue operating as a viable economic entity. A member cannot take more than 6 months of consecutive leave without resigning their membership in the cooperative. We encourage contractors to keep us informed as to their availability on a regular basis.
Members and member-track contractors are **not required to provide an explanation for why** they are taking paid or unpaid time off. Approval of unpaid time off shall not be contingent upon the member providing a justification for their request.

## Paid Time-Off

**Provided to:** Employee-Members only

Members accrue **1 hour of paid time off for each 52 hours of work**. This is equivalent to getting 1 week (5 days) of paid time off each year when working at a rate of 30 hours per week. Catalyst will not loan paid time off hours to members in advance of their accrual; members cannot use paid time off hours that they have not yet accrued. At the end of each year, unused paid time off hours roll over to the next year. If a member leaves from the cooperative and has accrued paid time off hours, those hours will be converted to payments made in the same manner as the member’s internal capital account redemption.

New members are granted 10 hours of paid time off to start with, to reflect the time they spent as a candidate / contractor.

## Health Care

**Provided to:** Members & Contractors

Catalyst provides a healthcare reimbursement of **$400 a month** to members and contractors working 1000 hours per year on a rolling 12 month basis (or in the case of new contractors/employees, the prorated amount of hours since they began working).

## Retirement Accounts

**Provided to:** Employee-Members only

Catalyst employees can contribute to a tax-deferred [Vanguard SIMPLE IRA](https://investor.vanguard.com/small-business-retirement-plans/simple-ira) and the co-op will match 3% of the employee’s wages. The IRS limit on annual employee contributions as of 2022 is $14,000. Here is a good summary of [how a SIMPLE IRA works](https://www.paychex.com/articles/employee-benefits/what-is-a-simple-ira) . Employees can contribute to the SIMPLE IRA and still contribute to a traditional individual IRA or Roth IRA.
