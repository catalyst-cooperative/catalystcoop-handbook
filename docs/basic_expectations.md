# Basic Expectations

## Compensation

**Provided to:** Members & Contractors

Catalyst pays its employees and contractors $36.75 / hour.

Catalyst employees are paid through a monthly payroll which is run monthly at the end of the first week of the month. Paychecks should be deposited electronically by the 15th of the month.

## Expected Hours

### Weekly Hours

In line with our goal of allowing members time to pursue activities outside of work, Catalyst has generally adopted a **30 hour work week**, with the understanding that some weeks may have more or fewer hours worked.

### Annual Hours

Each **member** must work at least **1000 hours per calendar year** in order to maintain their membership in the cooperative. This is equivalent to averaging 20 hours of work per week (or half of a normal 40 hr/week FTE). For new members who join the cooperative partway through the calendar year, this requirement will be prorated and applied only to the portion of the year during which they were working for the cooperative, including their 6 month candidacy period. Steven Winter shall only be required to work an average of 10 hours per week to retain his membership in the cooperative.

**Member-track contractors** must work **500 hours during a six month candidacy period** in order to be eligible for co-op membership.
