# Article IX: Allocations and Distributions

## A. Fiscal Year

The fiscal year of the Cooperative shall end on the last day of December of each year.

## B. Definitions

“Surplus” shall be defined as the excess of revenues over expenses for a fiscal year attributable to Member labor.

“Profit” shall be defined as the excess of revenues over expenses for a fiscal year attributable to non-Member labor.

“Loss” shall be defined as the excess of expenses over revenues for a fiscal year.

Surplus, Profit, and Loss shall be determined on a tax basis.  Surplus and Profit shall not include cash contributions by Members to capital.

“Expenses” shall include Distributions paid pursuant to Section IX(K), payments of any interest and principal on any debts of the Cooperative, and reasonable reserves as determined by the Board of Directors.

The “Collective Account” shall be Surplus, Profit, and reserves that are retained in the Cooperative and not distributed to members.

“Patronage” shall be defined by determination of the Board of Directors as a Member’s total hours worked for the Cooperative in a calendar year as a percent of the total hours worked for the Cooperative in that year by all Members.

“Patronage Dividends” shall have the definition contained in Internal Revenue Code Section 1388(a) (dividends paid to Members based on Patronage), the payment of which may be declined by the payee at their sole option and, if declined, shall be allocated to the Collective Account.

“Member Account” shall be defined as each Member’s capital account in the Cooperative (Initial Capital Contribution plus written notices of allocation minus Distributions and Losses plus/minus any other item that affects the balance in the Member’s capital account).

“Distribution” means the distribution of dividends, but does not include Patronage Dividends.

## C. Allocations

The Cooperative shall have a system of internal capital accounts as equity accounts to reflect its net worth, to reflect the allocation of net worth among the Members and Preferred Stockholders, and to determine the redemption value of Class A Common Stock, Preferred Stock, and written notices of allocation. The internal capital accounts consist of individual capital accounts, a retained earnings account, and any Preferred Stock accounts. The sum of the balances of the internal capital accounts is the net worth of the Cooperative.

Any Profit shall be credited to the Collective Account.

The Board shall have the discretion to allocate any Surplus or Loss between the Collective Account and Member Accounts, the latter which shall be allocated as Patronage Dividends in direct proportion to Patronage during the fiscal year.  The Board shall have the authority to determine the need for and amount of a reasonable reserve, to be allocated to the Collective Account.

If a Loss is debited to an individual Member Account that represents Surplus previously credited to the Member in the form of a non-qualified written notice of allocation, the Member will either be directed by the Board of Directors to pay an assessment to cover the Loss (resulting in a reduction in current tax liability) or the Loss will be carried back or forward.

## D. Patronage Dividends

The Board shall have the discretion to determine the proportion of any Patronage Dividends made in cash payments and made to each individual Member Account as a written notice of allocation, so long as at least 20% is distributed in cash.

Patronage Dividends may be by qualified or non-qualified written notices of allocation or a combination of the two.

## E. Member’s Consent and Covenant to Declare Income for Tax Purposes

Each Member shall take into account on their income tax return the amount of any Patronage Dividends which are made in qualified written notices of allocation (as defined in 26 U.S.C. Section 1388) at their stated dollar amounts in the manner provided in 26 U.S.C. Section 1385(a) in the taxable year in which such written notices of allocation are received by the Member.

## F. Payment Rights Regarding Member Accounts

When a Member’s Membership in the Cooperative is terminated for any reason, the amount in their Member Account will automatically be redeemed in exchange for debt or other interest as determined by the Board of Directors.  The Cooperative shall repay the debt within five years of the Membership termination, with interest accruing at the discount rate adopted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City plus two percent, on the amount outstanding at the end of each fiscal year.

The Cooperative, in settling a Member Account, shall have the right to set off any and all indebtedness of the former Member to the Cooperative.

## G. Periodic Redemption of Member Accounts

The Cooperative shall aim to pay out in cash to the Members all funds in excess of their Initial Capital Contributions credited to their Member Accounts within three years after the date they were first credited.  As a general rule, written notices of allocation credited to Member Accounts (including notices now converted to debt) will be paid out in the order in which they are credited, with the oldest paid out first; however, the Board of Directors can decide to accelerate the repayment of debt owed to former Members on a case by case basis.  If the Cooperative does not have sufficient funds to pay out all funds credited to Member Accounts for a given fiscal year, then funds will be paid out in proportion to the balance in the Member Accounts.

## H. Unclaimed Equity Interests

If permissible under Colorado law, any proprietary interest in the Cooperative held by a Member that would otherwise escheat to the State of Colorado as unclaimed personal property shall instead become the property of the Cooperative if the Cooperative follows Colorado law with respect to such transfer, including but not limited any requirements for notice to the affected Member.  No property or funds shall become the property of the Cooperative under this section if written notice objecting to the transfer is received by the Cooperative from the affected Member prior to the date of the proposed transfer.

## I. Dissolution Distributions

Upon liquidation, dissolution, or sale of the assets of the Cooperative, and to the extent represented in the records of the Cooperative, any assets left after payment of all debts and Member Account balances, including distribution on shares of preferred stock equal to the original purchase price, plus any declared but unredeemed dividends and any reinvested dividends (“Preferred Stock Liquidation Distribution”), shall be distributed to all persons who are Members in good standing or left the Cooperative as Members in good standing, or to their heirs, in proportion to such Members’ proportional Patronage of the Cooperative relative to the aggregate of all Members’ Patronage since the inception of the Cooperative, except that all of the remaining intellectual property of the Cooperative is to be released to the public under an open source/creative commons/open data-type license.  No distribution need be made to any person who fails to acknowledge the receipt of notice of liquidation, dissolution, or sale of assets in a timely manner, which shall be limited to 30 days of the date of the written notice.  Said notice shall be deemed sufficient if sent by certified mail or transmitted electronically, at least 30 days before distribution of any residual assets, to the person’s last known business or residence address.  Provided distributions are made in accordance with this provision, the amount and form of distribution shall be final, binding and not subject to adjustment.

## J. Maintaining Equitable Membership Contributions

In order to ensure that Membership in the Cooperative may remain accessible for persons of modest means, the Cooperative will not raise its Initial Capital Contribution at a rate greater than the growth of the Consumer Price Index for the Denver Metro Area defined by the United States Department of Labor.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this provision may be modified as necessary to comply with applicable federal and state tax requirements.

## K. Dividends on Preferred Shares

Dividends, if any, on Preferred Shares shall be paid in accordance with the terms by which the shares were issued.

## L. Shareholder Accounts

For each person who holds Preferred Shares issued by the Cooperative, the Cooperative shall maintain a shareholder account that reflects the value of such shares as a portion of the equity of the Cooperative. The balance in any shareholder account is determined in accordance with the terms by which the Cooperative issued the Preferred Shares and with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.

## M. Redemption of Preferred Shares

The Cooperative shall redeem Preferred Shares in accordance with their terms.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cooperative shall be under no obligation to redeem shares of Preferred Stock if doing so would cause financial harm or jeopardy to the Cooperative.  The Board shall have the power and reserves the right to delay, suspend, or decline redemption of shares of Preferred Stock in accordance herewith.

## N. Range of Compensation within the Cooperative

No Member may be paid hourly compensation (not including Patronage Dividends) at a rate more than five times the hourly compensation rate (not including Patronage Dividends) of the Member with the lowest hourly compensation rate.
