# Article IV: Member Meetings

## A. Distinction between Membership and Board Meetings

Until such time as there are more than ten Members, all Members of the Cooperative shall serve on the Board of Directors and no person other than the Members of the Cooperative shall serve on the Board of Directors. Any meeting of the Members at which attendees neglect to specify whether they are meeting as Members or as directors shall be considered a Board of Directors meeting.  All Cooperative decisions shall be made by the Board of Directors, except that the following acts require voting as Members:

1. Acceptance and removal of Members;
1. Election of directors;
1. Dissolution of the Cooperative;
1. Amendments of these Bylaws; and
1. Amendments to the Articles of Incorporation

## B. Member Voting

The voting power of the Members shall be equal (one Member, one vote). Whenever Members are disqualified from voting on any matter, they shall not be counted for the determination of a quorum or the required vote to approve an action. There shall be no voting by proxy. There shall be no cumulative voting.

## C. Annual Meeting

The annual meeting of the Members shall be held during the first calendar quarter of each year, as scheduled by the Board of Directors, and shall be for the purpose of undertaking the election of directors should the number of Members exceed ten, and for the transaction of such other business as specified by the President, by the Board of Directors, or by at least ten percent of the Members. If the election of directors shall not be held as specified by these Bylaws, the Board of Directors by unanimous vote shall cause a special election to be held as soon as convenient.

## D. Special Meetings

Special meetings of the Members for any lawful purpose may be called by the President, by the Board of Directors, or by at least ten percent or more of the Members, as evidenced by a written signed petition. The Secretary shall provide written notice of such meeting at least ten days prior thereto.

## E. Place of Meeting

The Board of Directors may hold meetings electronically or designate any place as the place for any annual meeting or special meeting.

## F. Participation by Electronic Transmission

Members not physically present in person at a meeting of Members may, by electronic transmission, participate in a meeting, be deemed present in person, and vote at a meeting of Members, and the Cooperative will implement measures to provide Members a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the Members, including an opportunity to read or hear, and interactively participate in the proceedings of the meeting concurrently with those proceedings.

## G. Notice

Whenever the Members meet, written notice of the meeting shall be transmitted not less than ten days before and no more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each Member who, on the record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote.

The notice shall state the place, date, and time of the meeting, and (1) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted, and that no other business may be transacted, or (2) in the case of the regular meeting, those matters which the Board of Directors, at the time the notice is given, intends to present to the Members.

## H. Waiver of Notice

The transactions of any meeting of Members however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as though done at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the persons entitled to vote, not present in person or by electronic transmission, provides a waiver of notice or consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof in writing.

## I. Quorum

A majority of the Members in good standing shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Members.

The Members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Members to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the Members required to constitute a quorum.

In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of Members may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the Members present, but no other business may be transacted except as provided in the preceding paragraph.

## J. Action Without a Meeting

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Members may be taken without a meeting, if all Members shall individually or collectively consent in writing to such action.  In addition, any action which may be taken at any regular or special meeting of Members may be taken without a meeting if the Cooperative distributes a written ballot to every Member entitled to vote on the matter.  That ballot and any related material may be sent by electronic transmission by the Cooperative and responses may be returned to the Cooperative by electronic transmission.  That ballot shall set forth the proposed action, provide an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval of any proposal, and provide a reasonable time within which to return the ballot to the Cooperative.

Approval by written ballot pursuant to this section shall be valid only when the number of votes cast by ballot within the time period specified equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action, and the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required to approve at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by ballot.

## K. Record Date

The Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to notice of any meeting of Members.  Such record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than ten days before the date of the meeting.  If no record date is fixed, Members at the close of business on the business day preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day preceding the day on which the meeting is held are entitled to notice of a meeting of Members.
