# Article XI: Transfer of Memberships

No Member or holder of Preferred Stock may assign or transfer their Membership or any right arising therefrom.  Any attempted assignment or transfer shall be wholly void and shall confer no rights on the intended assignee or transferee.  All rights as a Member of the Cooperative cease upon the Member’s death, except with respect to the redemption rights, if any, of such Member’s heirs.
