# Article X: Checks and Contracts

## A. Authorized Signatories for Checks

All checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes, or other evidence of indebtedness issued in the name of or payable to the Cooperative will be signed or endorsed by the person or persons in the manner authorized from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors.

## B. Executing Corporate Contracts and Instruments

The Board of Directors by resolution may authorize any officer, officers, employee, employees, agent, or agents to enter into any contract or to execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the Cooperative.  This authority may be general or it may be confined to one or more specific matters.  No officer, employee, agent, or other person purporting to act on behalf of the Cooperative will have any power or authority to bind the Cooperative in any way, to pledge the Cooperativeâ€™s credit, or to render the Cooperative liable for any purpose or in any amount, unless that person was acting with authority granted by the Board of Directors as provided in these Bylaws, or unless an unauthorized act was later ratified by a vote of the Board of Directors.
