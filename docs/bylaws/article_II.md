# Article II: Purposes

The Cooperative shall strive to perform data and policy analysis in support of creating a more just, livable, and sustainable world for all humanity with focus areas including climate and energy policies, electric utility regulation and finances, and land-use, transportation, and housing policies.

The Cooperative shall strive to provide members with fulfilling work that is equitably compensated, while also allowing them the flexibility to pursue other paths in life. The Cooperative may produce free or low-cost and thus more widely available data products, applications, and policy analyses to help educate the public, inform public policymaking, and level the playing field between profit-maximizing and non-commercial interests.

The Cooperative may also have as one or more of its purposes any purpose or purposes permitted for cooperatives under Colorado law. The Cooperative shall be operated on a cooperative basis for the mutual benefit of its members.
