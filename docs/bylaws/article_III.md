# Article III: Membership and Shareholders

## A. Membership Qualifications

A natural person, a corporate entity, or a limited liability entity may become a member of the Cooperative, and be issued a single share of Class A Common Stock, by:

1. Making payment of the Initial Capital Contribution;
1. Working at least 500 hours within a six-month period for the Cooperative (“Candidacy Period”);
1. Being approved by an affirmative vote of at least 75% of the Members following the Candidacy Period;
1. Paying such annual fees as may be set by the Board of Directors, and;
1. Signing the Cooperative’s membership agreement, receiving a copy of these Bylaws and a receipt.

By an affirmative vote of at least 75% of the Members, a natural person who was removed from or who had resigned from the Cooperative may be readmitted as a Member of the Cooperative without completing the Candidacy Period.

## B. Classification of Members and Shares

The Cooperative shall have one class of Members, as qualified and admitted pursuant to subsection A. The Cooperative also has the authority to issue one class of common stock (hereinafter, "Class A Common Stock").

1. Only Members may own Class A Common Stock, except that, in the event of the death of a Member, their estate may hold the stock pending possible repurchase by the Cooperative.
1. The cost and terms of Class A Common Stock shall be as determined by the Board of Directors from time to time, and such cost is designated as the "Initial Capital Contribution."

## C. Member Resignation

A Member shall have the right to resign as a Member of the Cooperative by filing with the secretary of the Cooperative a written notice of resignation.  The resignation shall become effective immediately without any action on the part of the Cooperative. If a Member takes more than six (6) consecutive months of unpaid leave from the Cooperative, the Member shall automatically resign from the Cooperative. If a Member works less than one thousand (1,000) hours per calendar year, or less than a lower minimum number of hours set by the Board of Directors for that Member per calendar year, the Member shall automatically resign from the Cooperative. If a Member is admitted to the Cooperative during the calendar year, that Member’s required annual minimum number of hours shall be prorated in proportion to the period between the date of their admittance to the Cooperative and the end of the calendar year. Resignation shall not relieve the resigning Member from any obligation to pay charges incurred, dues, assessments, or fees, and this section shall not diminish any right of the Cooperative to enforce any such obligation or obtain damages for its breach.

## D. Dispute Resolution

Upon a dispute between the Member and the Cooperative or the Member and any other member of the Cooperative (in either case, the “Disputing Parties”), the Disputing Parties agree to attempt to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) days.

If the Disputing Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) days, the Disputing Parties shall endeavor to resolve the dispute by mediation. The Disputing Parties shall promptly select a mutually agreeable, neutral third party to help them mediate the dispute. If the Disputing Parties are unable to select a neutral third party within fifteen (15) days, a mediator shall be appointed by the American Arbitration Association in Denver, Colorado. The Disputing Parties shall meet with the mediator within twenty (20) days after the date a mediator is selected. The Disputing Parties shall each bear half of the cost of the mediation, but each of the Disputing Parties shall be responsible for their own costs and attorney's fees.

If the mediation is unsuccessful, the Disputing Parties shall resolve the dispute through binding arbitration. The Disputing Parties shall promptly select a mutually agreeable arbitrator, and if the Disputing Parties are unable to agree on such an arbitrator within fifteen (15) days, an arbitrator shall be appointed by the American Arbitration Association in Denver, Colorado. The Disputing Parties shall meet with the arbitrator as soon as practicable, and the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Disputing Parties and may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction by either party.  The Disputing Parties shall each bear half of the cost of the arbitration, but each of the Disputing Parties shall be responsible for their own costs and attorney's fees.

## E. Removal of Members

No Member may be removed or suspended, and no membership or memberships may be terminated or suspended, except according to procedures satisfying the requirements of this section.

A Member may for any lawful reason, including but not limited to failing to make timely payment of any annual or other fee for Members set by the Board of Directors, be removed from the Cooperative.

By majority vote, the Board of Directors may move to refer a vote to remove a Member to the Members at a meeting of the Members to be held 15 days after the Board’s decision. Prior to the vote of the Members, the Member subject to potential removal shall be allowed to respond in their own defense before the Board of Directors at an agreed upon time and place. If necessary under exigent circumstances to protect the Cooperative’s material interests from imminent and irreparable harm, the Board of Directors may move to suspend a Member prior to the meeting of the Members. Such suspension may include denying the Member access to Cooperative-related accounts and communications.

At the referenced meeting of the Members to consider such removal, so long as a quorum is present the Member may be removed from membership in the Cooperative by a vote of at least 75% of the Members present at such meeting.

Removal, suspension or termination shall not relieve the resigning Member from any obligation to pay charges incurred, dues, assessments, or fees, and this section shall not diminish any right of the Cooperative to enforce any such obligation or obtain damages for its breach.

A Member who is removed or suspended or whose Membership is terminated shall be liable for any charges, dues, assessments, or fees incurred due to removal, suspension, or termination.

## F. Preferred Stock

The Cooperative may issue Preferred Stock in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and such terms as designated by the Board of Directors.

## G. Transfer Restrictions

No Membership or share of any class or interest therein may be sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred, voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, except for a transfer to the Cooperative. The share or interest of a deceased Member may be held by their estate pending transfer to the Cooperative.
