# Article V: Directors

## A. Directors and Board Composition

Should the number of Members exceed ten, the Members shall call a special meeting for the purpose of electing a Board of Directors.

The number of directors shall be not less than three nor more than seven. The first Board of Directors elected by the members shall have five directors.

## B. Terms of Office

The term of office of the directors shall be one year. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until a successor has been elected and qualified. A person whose Membership is terminated shall immediately cease to be a director of the Cooperative.

## C. Nomination of Board

Any Member in good standing may nominate a Member in good standing to be added to the ballot as a candidate for the Board of Directors at least ten days prior to the notice of a Board of Directors election.

## D. Election of Board of Directors

Directors shall be elected by assigning a number of points to each candidate based on their ranking by each Member voter. If N is the number of directors to be elected, then on each Member ballot the candidate selected first receives N points, the candidate selected second receives N-1 points, third N-2 points, etc. The N candidates receiving the highest number of points will be elected as directors. In the event of a tie for the last position, the winner(s) shall be chosen by straws.

## E. Board of Directors Voting

The vote of a majority of the directors in good standing and disinterested in the particular transaction to be voted upon, and present at a duly called and noticed meeting at which a quorum is present is the act of the Board of Directors.
F. Notice of Board Meetings
Regular Board of Directors meetings shall be electronically noticed to all directors by the Secretary of the Cooperative not less than ten days before the date of the meeting.

Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held upon at least 48 hours’ notice delivered electronically to all directors by the Secretary of the Cooperative.

A notice, or waiver of notice, need not specify the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors.

## G. Waiver of Notice

Notice of a meeting need not be given to any director who provides a waiver of notice or consent to holding the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof in writing, whether before or after the meeting, or who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its commencement, the lack of notice to that director.

## H. Participation by Electronic Transmission

Directors may participate in a meeting through use of electronic transmission as long as all directors participating in the meeting are able to read or hear, and interactively participate in the proceedings of the meeting concurrently with those proceedings.

## I. Quorum

A majority of directors then in office and in good standing constitutes a quorum of the Board of Directors for the transaction of business.

A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for the meeting.

## J. Adjournment

A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any meeting begun with a quorum to another time and place.

## K. Action Without a Meeting

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting, if all directors shall individually or collectively consent in writing to such action.

## L. Board Vacancies

This section applies only if the number of Members exceeds ten and a Board of Directors has been elected.

“Vacancy” when used with respect to the board means any authorized position of director which is not then filled, whether the vacancy is caused by death, resignation, removal, change in the number of directors, or otherwise.

The Board of Directors may declare vacant the office of a director whose eligibility for election as a director has ceased, or who has been declared of unsound mind by a final order of court, or convicted of a felony.

Except for a vacancy created by the removal of a director, vacancies on the Board of Directors may be filled until the next annual meeting of Members by approval of the Board of Directors or, if the number of directors then in office is less than a quorum, by the unanimous written consent of the directors.

The Members may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the directors.

## M. Resignation

This section applies only if the number of Members exceeds ten and a Board of Directors has been elected. Any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the President or the Secretary, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation.

## N. Removal

So long as all Members constitute the Board of Directors, directors may not be removed except if they cease to be Members. If the number of Members exceeds ten and a Board of Directors has been elected, a director may at any time be removed from office for cause or without cause by a vote of a majority of the Members, excluding the director subject to the removal vote. A director may be removed for cause only after reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard before the body proposing to remove the director.

Any reduction of the authorized number of directors does not remove any director prior to the expiration of the director’s term of office.
